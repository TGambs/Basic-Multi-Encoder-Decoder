# Basic-Multi-Encoder-Decoder
## Originally created and left ~2021 but recently updated and debugged 12/07/24

This program allows for:
- Text traslation to Hex, Binary, Ascii85, Ascii, Base16, Base32 and Base64
- Hex, Binary, Ascii85 and Ascii translation to text


### ----- Bugs/Errors -----
- Using ENTER as an input can result in the program failing as a catch hasn't been implemented yet
- Entering the wrong 'language' in the decoder causes the program to crash
